# 3 Body Simulation in Python
This repository will hold all the code needed for the 3 body simulation. 
<br>Currently, there are 3 classes: ```interface```, ```simulate```, and ```planets```.
### The ```Interface``` Class:
* This class will takes a planet's coordinate location and plot it on the screen.

### The ```Simulate``` Class:
* This class will compute the planets' new coordinates based off the planets' old data.

### The ```Planets``` Class:
* This class will store data such as forces and velocity.
